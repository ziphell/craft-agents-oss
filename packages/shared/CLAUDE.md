# CLAUDE.md — `@craft-agent/shared`

## Purpose
Core business logic package for Craft Agent:
- Agent backends and session-scoped tools
- Sources, credentials, sessions, and config
- Permission modes and validation

## Key folders
- `src/agent/` — `claude-agent.ts`, `pi-agent.ts`, `base-agent.ts`, tools, permissions
- `src/sources/` — source storage/types/services
- `src/sessions/` — session persistence/index
- `src/projects/` — workspace-scoped projects (config + assets); sessions bind via `projectId`
- `src/pages/` — workspace-scoped mini dashboards (`pages/{slug}/page.json`); storage, refresh hook, action bridge
- `src/config/` — config/preferences/theme/watcher
- `src/credentials/` — encrypted credential management

## Commands
From repo root:
```bash
cd packages/shared && bun run tsc --noEmit
```

## Hard rules
- Permission modes are fixed: `safe`, `ask`, `allow-all`.
- Source types are fixed: `mcp`, `api`, `local`.
- Keep credential handling in `src/credentials/` pathways (no ad-hoc secret storage).
- Keep user-facing tool contracts backward-compatible where possible.

## Notes
- `ClaudeAgent` is the primary class in `src/agent/claude-agent.ts`.
- **Reserved "Task" labels.** Task flows tag each task's whole family (orchestrator + subtasks) with a per-task ITEM label — a child of the plain root `Task` label, named `TASK-<slug>-<N>` (no valueType; N = max counter across the root's TASK-named children + 1, never recycled — unrelated children of an adopted user root don't feed it). Mint/inherit only via `SessionManager.applyTaskLabel` (which uses `ensureTaskLabel`/`ensureTaskItemLabel` in `labels/crud.ts`); resolve only via `findTaskLabel` / `findTaskItemLabelId` / `resolveTaskScopeLabelId` (`labels/filter.ts`). Never assume literal ids — slugs collide-shift, so always use the resolved id (surfaced as `TaskCreateResult.taskLabelId`). Legacy `task::N` valued entries still filter under the root; `ensureTaskLabel` converges a legacy `valueType: 'number'` root to a plain label but adopts a user's own root "Task" label as-is (shape + children untouched).
- **Single label-filter predicate.** `matchesLabelFilter` (`labels/filter.ts`, browser-safe) is the only implementation of "session matches a label filter" (descendants, `__all__`, optional `projectId` scope). The session list, AppShell filtered set, and NavigationContext auto-select all route through it — do not hand-roll label matching in feature code.
- Claude SDK subprocess env is sanitized to strip Claude-specific Bedrock routing vars (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`). Pi Bedrock uses its own AWS env path instead. On Windows the same builder (`agent/options.ts:buildClaudeSubprocessEnv`) also injects `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` from the user-configured `gitBashPath` (`config/storage.ts:getGitBashPath`) when unset, so the SDK's Bash tool honors per-user Git installs instead of only the hardcoded `Program Files` search (#935).
- MCP proxy tool names are built ONLY via `proxyToolName(slug, name)` (`mcp/proxy-tool-name.ts`), which sanitizes characters outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` (e.g. dots) so OpenAI/Codex accept them. The name is an opaque exact-match key in `McpClientPool.proxyTools`, so build (`registerClient`), emit (`getProxyToolDefs`), Pi registration, and the Claude-side `pool.callTool` (`claude-agent.ts`) must ALL use this one builder or the dispatch key drifts (#864, regression of #498). Post-sanitization collisions keep the FIRST tool and `console.warn` the skipped one (a silently vanishing tool must leave a trail); deterministic disambiguation is a known possible follow-up.
- Backward alias export (`CraftAgent`) exists for compatibility.
- Prefer routing new model vendors through the existing Pi path (`providerType: 'pi'` + `piAuthProvider`) unless they truly need a distinct runtime/backend. The Pi provider catalog and display metadata live in `src/config/models-pi.ts`.
- Custom endpoint model capabilities must preserve explicit per-model overrides end-to-end. In particular, `supportsImages: true` enables image input for one model and `supportsImages: false` must remain available to override a global endpoint image default. Active Pi custom-endpoint sessions refresh runtime capabilities via `updateRuntimeConfig`; capability changes are pushed proactively from the `llmConnections.SAVE` handler through `SessionManager.refreshConnectionRuntime`, with the lazy `getOrCreateAgent` path acting as a backstop. The session layer still gates image attachments at send time so disabled images are not sent even if a subprocess refresh fails.
- `update_runtime_config` IPC carries `model, providerType, authType, baseUrl, customEndpoint, customModels` only — `piAuthProvider`, `slug`, and the broader credential/provider routing state cannot be re-routed inside a live Pi subprocess. `runtime-config.ts:buildRestartRequiredSignature` hashes those fields separately from the in-place-safe ones; when the restart signature drifts, `tryRefreshAgentRuntime` skips the in-place attempt and goes straight to dispose + recreate so the new auth/provider state actually takes effect.
- Session lifecycle distinguishes **hard aborts** from **UI handoff interrupts**:
  - use hard aborts for true cancellation/teardown (`UserStop`, redirect fallback)
  - use handoff interrupts for pause points where control moves to the UI (`AuthRequest`, `PlanSubmitted`)
- Remote workspace handoff summaries are injected as one-shot hidden context on the destination session's first turn.
- **Task creation is a shared core.** `createTaskFromSpec` / `finishTaskOrchestrator` (`packages/server-core/src/tasks/create-task.ts`) implement "create the task on the board without running it" (task.yaml + orchestrator session + reserved TASK label + spec sources, fail-soft on label/sources). Both the `tasks:create` RPC fresh path and the agent-facing `create_task` session tool call it — never re-implement the flow. The tool path derives the slug via `uniqueTaskSlug` (`shared/tasks/slug.ts`, never overwrites; the TaskEditor keeps its own `slugify` copy because this barrel pulls Node fs code), inherits the invoking session's project unless `projectId` explicitly overrides it, and synthesizes the required single `main` node from the description; DAG authoring stays with the editor/`tasks:generate`. Running remains exclusively `tasks:run`/TaskRunner.
- WebUI source OAuth uses a stable relay redirect URI (`https://thecraftagents.com/auth/callback`); the deployment-specific callback target is carried in a relay-owned outer `state` envelope and unwrapped by the router worker.
- Automations matching is unified through canonical matcher adapters in `src/automations/utils.ts` (`matcherMatches*`). Avoid direct primitive-only matcher checks in feature code so condition gating stays consistent across app and agent events.
- **Automation actions are a STRICT discriminated union** (`prompt` | `webhook` | `script`) — the legacy `.passthrough()` arm is gone, so unknown action types now fail validation (whole config dropped by `loadConfig`, matching existing invalid-config behavior). The `script` action (`automations/script-executor.ts` + `handlers/script-handler.ts`) argv-spawns a workspace-local script via `resolveScriptRuntime` (never a shell), with a CRAFT_*-only child env (`buildScriptEnv`), symlink-aware workspace containment, SIGTERM→SIGKILL timeout, and a per-matcher concurrency lock (overlapping ticks are skipped and recorded in history). Adding an action type touches: `types.ts`, `schemas.ts`, a handler, `name-utils.ts`, `validation.ts`, and server-core `rpc/automations.ts` TEST.
- **Pages** (`src/pages/`): workspace entities at `pages/{slug}/` — `page.json` (config, validated on write; a `refresh.cron` is checked with croner — the same engine the scheduler matches with — and must parse, actually fire, and respect the 5-minute floor `PAGE_REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`), `index.html` (content; sha256 `contentDigest`), `data/` (script-private `store.sqlite` + atomically-written `snapshot.json`, the ONLY cross-process data contract). `page.json` is deliberately the LAST write of a refresh run — the config watcher reacts to it (and only it) with `pages:changed`. Scheduled refresh = `PageConfig.refresh` → synthetic cron matcher (`pages/refresh.ts`) merged into `AutomationSystem.getMatchersForEvent('SchedulerTick')`; rebuild via `reloadPageRefreshMatchers()` (wired to the watcher in SessionManager). `pages/data-store.ts` is **Bun-only** (`bun:sqlite`) — subpath `@craft-agent/shared/pages/data-store` only, never re-export from the pages barrel, never import from Electron main.
- **Page data writes from hosts** (`pages/data-write.ts`, Node-safe, ON the pages barrel): `writePageData`/`applyPageDataPatch` apply a `PageDataPatch` (kv set/delete + series append/prune) by generating a **self-contained Bun one-shot** (argv spawn via `resolveScriptRuntime`) — the SQLite handle never lives in the host process, and it works under both Node (Electron main) and Bun (headless) hosts, dev and packaged. The generated script duplicates the data-store schema/SQL **on purpose** (zero module resolution from a temp dir); parity is pinned by `data-write.test.ts` — change schema/snapshot shape in BOTH files + test or not at all. `writePageData` stamps `recordPageRefresh` LAST (watcher marker). Both engines set `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000` so concurrent refresh-script/tool writes wait instead of failing with SQLITE_BUSY, and both enforce the store growth caps (`PAGE_DATA_MAX_KV_KEYS` / `PAGE_DATA_MAX_SERIES`, data-store-constants.ts) post-write inside the write transaction — a violating write rolls back whole.
- **Pages session tools** (`list_pages`/`get_page` Explore-safe read-only; `create_page`/`update_page`/`write_page_data`/`delete_page` blocked in Explore — all derived from `safeMode` metadata in session-tools-core `tool-defs.ts`): handlers live in session-tools-core (`handlers/pages.ts`) and call the **grouped** `ctx.pages` callbacks (`PagesToolCallbacks` — one registry field, unlike the flat session-management Fns) bound by `session-self-management-bindings.ts` and implemented in server-core `pages/tool-callbacks.ts` (wired per-session in SessionManager next to `createTaskFn`). Delete goes through `deletePageWithUnpublish` (publisher.ts), shared verbatim with the `pages:delete` RPC — never re-implement unpublish-before-delete. Agent-facing authoring guide: `apps/electron/resources/docs/pages.md` (auto-synced to `~/.craft-agent/docs/`); system-prompt section in `prompts/system.ts`.
- **Page thumbnails** (cached poster): `PageConfig.thumbnail` is a managed pointer (`{digest,capturedAt,w,h}`, excluded from `updatePage`, written only by `recordPageThumbnail`) to `pages/{slug}/thumbnail.jpg`. `isThumbnailFresh(config)` = `thumbnail.digest === contentDigest` (single source of truth, used by the `pages:getThumbnail` RPC and the capturer); a content change leaves the pointer but makes it stale (data-only refreshes do NOT invalidate — v1). Generation is Electron-main-only (`apps/electron` `page-thumbnailer.ts`), injected via `SessionManager.setPageThumbnailer`; `enqueuePageThumbnail` no-ops headless. Never re-export capture code from shared — shared only owns the storage/freshness helpers.
- **Page action bridge** (`pages/action-bridge.ts`): page JS never calls sources — `PageActionBroker` validates render leases (nonce + content digest + replay cache) and persisted grants (content-digest-bound + expiring, mirroring the privilegedExecutionBroker commandHash pattern), executes via injected executors under AbortSignal, and audit-logs every decision to `~/.craft-agent/logs/page-actions.jsonl` (redacted via `utils/redaction.ts`). Endpoint/tool policy lives in the freestanding `agent/source-policy.ts` (`evaluateApiEndpointPolicy` / `evaluateMcpToolPolicy`) — `shouldPromptInAskMode` delegates to it; use it for any non-hook policy check instead of re-implementing. `sources/api-tools.ts:executeApiRequest` is the single fetch path for API sources (supports `signal`/`timeoutMs`; never logs header values), and `PoolClient.callTool` accepts `{ signal, timeoutMs }` forwarded to the MCP SDK.
- **Pages sharing** (`pages/share-bundle.ts` + `pages/publisher.ts`, flag `CRAFT_FEATURE_PAGES_SHARING` default **ON** since 2026-08-27 — Worker deployed live; set `=0` to opt out): publishes a sanitized bundle (allowlisted manifest + index.html + opt-in snapshot; grants/refresh/sqlite/paths excluded by construction) to the `workers/pages` Cloudflare Worker. The publication **admin token** is a 256-bit capability stored ONLY in the credential vault as `page_publish_token::{workspaceId}::{pageId}` — never in `page.json` (`PageConfig.share` is a display pointer written via `setPageShareState`; `updatePage` treats `share` as managed). The flag gates publish/republish/password only — **unpublish always works** (RPC `pages:unpublish`; page delete auto-unpublishes best-effort). Pages with **usable** grants (`isPageGrantUsable`: digest-bound + unexpired — the single usable/stale definition, shared with the render frame and `get_page`) require `viewOnlyAcknowledged` (public copy answers bridge actions with `public-actions-disabled`); a **script** grant refuses publish outright even when stale — the remedy is removal (`pages:revokeGrant`, surfaced in the Share dialog and the page's Approved-actions dialog), never bypass. Local dev endpoint override: `CRAFT_PAGES_SHARE_API_URL`. Worker code/tests/deploy: `workers/pages/` (bun-testable end-to-end without Cloudflare).
- Automation matchers may declare an optional `telegramTopic?: string` to route spawned sessions into a Telegram forum topic in the workspace's paired supergroup. The field is plumbed through `PendingPrompt` and `ExecutePromptAutomationInput`; runtime resolution and topic creation live in `@craft-agent/messaging-gateway`'s `TopicRegistry` and `MessagingGatewayRegistry.bindAutomationSession`. SessionManager picks up the resolution via the optional `setAutomationBinder` hook installed by the messaging-gateway bootstrap.
- The OpenAI Chat Completions strip stream (`unified-network-interceptor.ts:createOpenAiSseStrippingStream`) emits **one consolidated SSE event per logical tool call** with `id + name + cleanArgs` together — never split across init + args-only deltas. Some downstream SDKs (Pi SDK) treat args-only deltas as new tool_calls instead of merging by index, which produces duplicate empty-id entries on parallel-tool turns from DeepSeek and other relays. `sanitizeOpenAiHistoryInPlace` recovers sessions whose history was persisted by the pre-fix split-emit version. A present-but-empty `tool_calls: []` delta is NOT a tool-call delta (the guard requires `length > 0`), so terminal `finish_reason` chunks that also carry `tool_calls: []` are no longer dropped — that dropping made custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints fail validation with "Stream ended without finish_reason" (#995). Forwarded chunks additionally get the empty `tool_calls` key stripped (re-serialized) so the Pi SDK never sees it at all.
- `LlmConnection.midStreamBehavior` controls whether mid-stream user sends try to steer the in-flight turn or hold for the next turn. Default is per-`providerType` via `defaultMidStreamBehavior()` (anthropic→`'queue'`, pi/pi_compat→`'steer'`). **Read everywhere via `resolveMidStreamBehavior(connection)`** — never branch on `providerType` directly for this decision; legacy connections without the field rely on the resolver's fallback. New connections persist the explicit default at `createBuiltInConnection` time so the Settings → AI submenu shows a checkmark on first load. The decision is made in `SessionManager.sendMessage`'s mid-stream branch only — backend code (`claude-agent.ts`, `pi-agent.ts`) is unchanged: `'queue'` mode skips `agent.redirect()` entirely and lets the current turn finish before replay. Two correctness invariants live in this branch: (1) `managed.wasInterrupted` is set **only** on the steer path (where an actual `forceAbort` happened) — pure `'queue'` mode must NOT set it, otherwise the replayed turn injects the "previous response was interrupted and may be incomplete" reminder for a turn that actually completed, confusing the model. (2) The mid-stream user message is created with a queue-time timestamp (mid-stream, i.e. *before* the in-flight assistant reply is finalized at `text_complete`); `processNextQueuedMessage` **re-stamps** it via `this.monotonic()` on replay so it sorts after the prior turn's finalized reply — `groupMessagesByTurn` (`@craft-agent/ui`) orders by timestamp. The emitted `user_message` event with `status: 'processing'` is the live-renderer reconciliation point: `handleUserMessage` must copy that canonical timestamp onto the already-mounted optimistic message while preserving its optimistic ID. Persisting the re-stamp server-side alone fixes reload order but leaves the live transcript wrong.
- The network interceptor (`unified-network-interceptor.ts`) is currently **Pi-only**: it preloads into the Pi subprocess via Bun `--preload`. The Claude SDK no longer runs under Bun (since 0.2.113 it spawns a per-platform native `claude` binary), so `--preload` is not available there. Features that used to live in the interceptor for Claude (rich tool intent, fast-mode override, MalformedBodyError validation, etc.) are Phase-2 work — they'll need to move to SDK hooks or a local proxy. In dev / monorepo runs, the Pi interceptor still preloads from the .ts source so changes propagate without a rebuild; packaged builds use `apps/electron/dist/interceptor.cjs`. See `agent/backend/internal/runtime-resolver.ts:resolveInterceptorBundlePath`.
- **Pi turn completion is adapter-driven** (`agent/backend/pi/event-adapter.ts`). `PiEventAdapter` runs two recovery state machines that hold the Craft event queue open across SDK flows that continue *after* an `agent_end`: context-overflow compaction (`_runAutoCompaction("overflow") → agent.continue()`) and the SDK's auto-retry of transient provider/transport errors (`agent_end { willRetry: true } → auto_retry_start → backoff → agent.continue()`). `PiAgent.handleSubprocessEvent` completes the queue only when `adapter.shouldCompleteQueue()` says so; hard aborts and subprocess teardown call `adapter.resetRecoveryState()`. Retryable errors (classified by pi-ai's `isRetryableAssistantError`, the same function the SDK uses) are parked, shown as a "Retrying…" status, and surfaced as one typed error only when retries are disabled/exhausted/cancelled — never yield them from `message_end` directly. Failed assistant streams emit identity-scoped `text_discard` before backoff (SessionManager cancels the pending batch; consumers remove only unfinished text); sub-turn IDs stay unique across SDK retries. Explicit `retry` backoff/active/end events own transient progress — never infer recovery from output. The retry policy lives in `packages/pi-agent-server/src/session-settings.ts` (`SettingsManager.inMemory`): main chats use 4 agent-level + 2 provider-level retries; utility sessions use a smaller policy and one 115-second execution deadline inside the host's 120-second RPC timeout. `EphemeralQueryCoordinator` aborts only the matching utility session, including on host `cancel_ephemeral_query`; pending host entries own their timer handles and utility errors carry request IDs for concurrency isolation. The subprocess must never fall back to the SDK default `SettingsManager.create(cwd, agentDir)`, which merges `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json` from the user's working directory.
- Per-message context is split into **volatile** vs **stable** blocks (`PromptBuilder.buildVolatileContextParts()` / `buildStableContextParts()`, composed by `buildContextParts()`). Volatile = date/time, `session_state`, `sources` (change per turn); stable = workspace capabilities, working directory (invariant per session). **Claude** keeps all blocks on the user-message tail (system prompt stays cacheable). **Pi** folds only stable blocks into the system prefix and routes volatile blocks to the user tail — otherwise a per-minute re-stamp invalidates pi-ai's cached system prefix and all downstream history (#862). `buildVolatileContextParts` consumes the one-shot mode-change signal (`consumeModeChangeUserSignal`), so call it **exactly once per turn** — never re-invoke a builder to compute a cache-debug hash (hash the produced string instead).
- Anthropic OAuth identity (account/org) is captured from the token-exchange response in `auth/claude-oauth.ts` (`parseClaudeOAuthIdentity`; fields are optional/fail-soft, never block login) and persisted on `LlmConnection` (`oauthAccountUuid/Email`, `oauthOrganizationUuid/Name`, `oauthProfileVerifiedAt`) by threading it through the `SETUP_LLM_CONNECTION` payload (`oauthIdentity`), **not** the EXCHANGE handler — the connection record is created by SETUP, which runs after the exchange. `updateLlmConnection` rebuilds connections from a hardcoded allowlist, so any new persisted field must be added there too or it is dropped on the next save (#838).
- **Mythos-class thinking (Claude Fable 5 / Mythos 5).** These models have adaptive thinking **always on** and the Messages API **rejects `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }`** (unlike Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, whose API is unchanged). `resolveClaudeThinkingOptions` therefore detects them via `isAdaptiveThinkingAlwaysOnModel()` (`config/models.ts`) and maps the "off"/`minimizeThinking` case to `{ thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }, effort: 'low' }` instead of `disabled` — there is no way to turn thinking off on these models. `runMiniCompletion` is unaffected (it runs on the resolved mini model, which is always Haiku). Model ids are the dateless pinned snapshots `claude-fable-5-1` and `claude-fable-5` (both 1M context, 128k max output); registered in `MODEL_REGISTRY` (5.1 listed first so `shortName: 'Fable'` resolves to the newest). The `isAdaptiveThinkingAlwaysOnModel()` regex matches the whole family, so future Fable/Mythos ids inherit the thinking handling without registry edits.

## i18n (Internationalization)

Translations live in `src/i18n/locales/{lang}.json`. All user-facing strings must use `t()` (React) or `i18n.t()` (non-React).

### Locale registry (single source of truth)

All locale metadata lives in **`src/i18n/registry.ts`**. To add a new locale:

1. Create `src/i18n/locales/{code}.json` with all keys (copy from `en.json`)
2. Import the messages and `date-fns` locale in `registry.ts`
3. Add one entry to `LOCALE_REGISTRY`

**That's it.** `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGE_CODES`, `LANGUAGES`, i18n resources, and `getDateLocale()` are all derived automatically. No other file needs to change.

### Key naming convention

Keys use **flat dot-notation** with a category prefix:

| Prefix | Scope | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `common.*` | Shared labels (Cancel, Save, Close, Edit, Loading...) | `common.cancel` |
| `menu.*` | App menu items (File, Edit, View, Window) | `menu.toggleSidebar` |
| `sidebar.*` | Left sidebar navigation items | `sidebar.allSessions` |
| `sidebarMenu.*` | Sidebar context menu actions | `sidebarMenu.addSource` |
| `sessionMenu.*` | Session context menu actions | `sessionMenu.archive` |
| `settings.*` | Settings pages — nested by page ID | `settings.ai.connections` |
| `chat.*` | Chat input, session viewer, inline UI | `chat.attachFiles` |
| `toast.*` | Toast/notification messages | `toast.failedToShare` |
| `errors.*` | Error screens | `errors.sessionNotFound` |
| `onboarding.*` | Onboarding flow — nested by step | `onboarding.welcome.title` |
| `dialog.*` | Modal dialogs | `dialog.reset.title` |
| `apiSetup.*` | API connection setup | `apiSetup.modelTier.best` |
| `workspace.*` | Workspace creation/management | `workspace.createNew` |
| `sourceInfo.*` | Source detail page | `sourceInfo.connection` |
| `skillInfo.*` | Skill detail page | `skillInfo.metadata` |
| `automations.*` | Automation list/detail/menus | `automations.runTest` |
| `sourcesList.*` | Sources list panel | `sourcesList.noSourcesConfigured` |
| `skillsList.*` | Skills list panel | `skillsList.addSkill` |
| `editPopover.*` | EditPopover labels/placeholders | `editPopover.label.addSource` |
| `status.*` | Session status names (by status ID) | `status.needs-review` |
| `mode.*` | Permission mode names (by mode ID) | `mode.safe` |
| `hints.*` | Empty state workflow suggestions | `hints.summarizeGmail` |
| `table.*` | Data table column headers | `table.access` |
| `time.*` | Relative time strings | `time.minutesAgo_other` |
| `session.*` | Session list UI | `session.noSessionsYet` |
| `shortcuts.*` | Keyboard shortcuts descriptions | `shortcuts.sendMessage` |
| `sendToWorkspace.*` | Send to workspace dialog | `sendToWorkspace.title` |
| `webui.*` | WebUI-specific strings | `webui.connectionFailed` |
| `auth.*` | Auth banner/prompts | `auth.connectionRequired` |
| `browser.*` | Browser empty state | `browser.readyTitle` |

### Rules

1. **Never call `i18n.t()` at module level** — store `labelKey` strings and resolve in components/functions.
2. **Use i18next pluralization** (`_one`/`_other`), never manual `count === 1 ?` logic.
3. **Keep brand names in English**: Craft, Craft Agents, Agents, Workspace, Claude, Anthropic, OpenAI, MCP, API, SDK.
4. **Include `...` in the translation value** if the UI needs an ellipsis — don't append it in JSX.
5. **Use `<Trans>` component** for translations containing HTML tags (e.g. `<strong>`).
6. **Use `i18n.resolvedLanguage`** (not `i18n.language`) when comparing against supported language codes.
7. **Keys must exist in every locale file** in `src/i18n/locales/` (not just `en.json` — `lint:i18n:parity` enforces this across the full set). Keep alphabetically sorted.
8. **Watch translation length for constrained UI elements.** Translations can be 20-100%+ longer than English. For buttons, badges, tab labels, and dropdown items, keep translations concise — use shorter synonyms if needed. High-risk areas:
   - Permission mode badges (3-5 characters max)
   - Settings tab labels (≤10 characters ideal)
   - Button labels (avoid exceeding 2x the English length)
   - Menu items (flexible, but avoid 3x+ growth)

### Validation

Three checks gate i18n correctness, all wired into pre-commit (`lint:i18n:staged`) and `validate:ci`:

| Script | Catches |
|--------|---------|
| `lint:i18n:sorted` | locale keys not alphabetical |
| `lint:i18n:parity` | non-EN locale missing keys present in `en.json`, or vice versa |
| `lint:i18n:coverage` | `t('...')` callsite referencing a key that doesn't exist in `en.json` |

`parity` alone is insufficient — it can't detect symmetric losses across all locales (a merge that drops the same 50 keys from every locale file passes parity but breaks the UI). `coverage` closes that gap by verifying every literal `t(...)` / `i18n.t(...)` / `<Trans i18nKey>` reference resolves against `en.json`. Dynamic keys (`t(\`status.${id}\`)`) are skipped — those surface via i18next's runtime missing-key warnings.

When resolving locale merge conflicts, run `bun run validate:ci` and trust the result — no manual key auditing needed if all three pass.

### Adding a new translated string

1. Add the key + English value to `en.json` (alphabetical order)
2. Add the key + translated value to **every other** `src/i18n/locales/*.json` file (run `bun run lint:i18n:parity` to confirm none were missed)
3. Use `t("your.key")` in the component (add `useTranslation()` hook if not present)
4. For non-React code, use `i18n.t("your.key")` — but only inside functions, never at module level

### Adding a new locale

1. Create `src/i18n/locales/{code}.json` with all keys from `en.json`
2. Add the entry to `LOCALE_REGISTRY` in `src/i18n/registry.ts` (messages + date-fns locale + native name)
3. Run tests — the registry tests will catch any missing wiring

### Cross-process language persistence

The main-process i18n instance has **no detection plugin** (no `localStorage` in Node) and would otherwise reset to `fallbackLng: 'en'` on every restart. To keep main + renderer in sync across launches:

- **Renderer** uses `i18next-browser-languagedetector` → `localStorage` (`i18nextLng`). Survives restart.
- **Main** hydrates on startup from `preferences.uiLanguage` in `~/.craft-agent/preferences.json`. Maintained only by the `i18n:changeLanguage` IPC handler in `apps/electron/src/main/index.ts`.
- **Renderer → main sync** happens on every Appearance change AND once at renderer startup (so a freshly-installed app immediately learns the persisted language).
- The IPC handler validates the incoming code against `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGE_CODES` and `setPersistedUiLanguage()` no-ops if the value is unchanged — startup pushes don't churn the file or the config watcher.

`uiLanguage` is **not** user-editable through `update_user_preferences`. The Appearance dropdown is the only writer.

**Session-title language** resolves from this same persisted `uiLanguage` via `resolveTitleLanguageName()` (`config/preferences.ts`), **not** `i18n.resolvedLanguage`. The main-process i18n value hydrates asynchronously at startup and can still read the `'en'` fallback when an early title generates, which forced English titles for non-English chats (#885). When no language is persisted the helper returns `undefined`, so the title prompt auto-detects the conversation language instead of defaulting to English. Used at both `SessionManager` title sites (`generateTitle`, `refreshTitle`).

## Token refresh for API sources

API sources can auto-refresh tokens via two paths:
- **OAuth** — Google, Slack, Microsoft, or generic OAuth (`authType: 'oauth'`)
- **Renew endpoint** — custom bearer-token APIs with `api.renewEndpoint` in config.json

For renew-endpoint sources, the current access token is sent to the configured endpoint and a new token is extracted from the response. No separate refresh token is needed (MVP scope).

Key integration points:
- `isRefreshableSource()` in `types.ts` — single guard for "can this source auto-refresh?"
- `SourceCredentialManager.refreshApiRenew()` — calls the renew endpoint
- `TokenRefreshManager` — treats renew-endpoint sources as refreshable even without `refreshToken`
- `server-builder.ts` — passes a token getter (not static credential) for renew-endpoint sources

## `queryLlm` backend contract

Every `AgentBackend.queryLlm(request: LLMQueryRequest)` implementation MUST:
- honor `request.model` (with backend-specific fallback only when the model is
  unresolvable/unsupported; always report the *effective* model in
  `LLMQueryResult.model`)
- honor `request.systemPrompt`

SHOULD:
- honor `request.outputSchema` (at minimum via prompt injection — see
  `buildCallLlmRequest` in `agent/llm-tool.ts`, which already handles this
  pre-backend)

MAY:
- honor `request.maxTokens` and `request.temperature` if the underlying SDK
  supports passing these to its generation call

MUST NOT:
- return a fabricated `LLMQueryResult.model` that doesn't match what was actually

IPC envelopes between the main process and any subprocess backend (Pi today,
potentially others) MUST carry the full `LLMQueryRequest`, not a subset.
A backend that invents a narrower envelope is guaranteed to drift over time
(see #596). The round-trip invariant is guarded by
`packages/shared/src/agent/__tests__/pi-query-llm.test.ts`.

## Source of truth
- Package exports: `packages/shared/src/index.ts` and subpath export entries.
- Agent exports: `packages/shared/src/agent/index.ts`
