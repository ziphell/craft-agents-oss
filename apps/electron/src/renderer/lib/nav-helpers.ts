 *
 * Per-navigator semantics:
 * - sessions: a session is selected
 * - settings: a subpage is selected (bare `settings` route → false)
 * - sources / skills / automations: a detail item is selected
 * - websites: always — both the library grid and a website render in the content
 *   panel (websites has no navigator list to fall back to)
