# Contributing to Craft Agents

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Craft Agents! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime
- Node.js 18+ (for some tooling)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss.git
   cd craft-agents-oss
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   ```

4. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   bun run electron:dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-tool` - New features
- `fix/resolve-auth-issue` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/simplify-agent-loop` - Code refactoring
- `docs/update-readme` - Documentation updates

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run type checking: `bun run typecheck:all`
4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages
5. Push to your fork and create a pull request

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript throughout the codebase
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Naming, domain words and user-facing copy have a written convention: [docs/vocabulary.md](docs/vocabulary.md) (e.g. a browser window holds **tabs**, a tab is given an **address**, and `page` means only what a browser displays)

### Type Checking

Before submitting a PR, ensure all type checks pass:

```bash
bun run typecheck:all
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
2. **Description**: Explain what the PR does and why
3. **Testing**: Describe how you tested the changes
4. **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes
